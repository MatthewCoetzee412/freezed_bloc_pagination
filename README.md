The chemical process of life
---

80% of the body is water

Metabolism - The chemical reactions which occur 
	     inside each living orgnism all the time


Metabolic reactions take place when chemicals 
dissolve in water

Water is needed for dissolving enzymes, and get
ride of waste products 

---
Carbohydrates
---

Carbs include starches and sugars

Carbs - Carbon(c), hydrogen(h) and oxygen(o)

Examples:
 - Simple sugars or monosaccharides
 - Complex sugars or disaccharides
    - Sucrose
    - Maltose
 - Many simple sugars = Poly saccarides
    - Cellulose
    - Starch

Animal cells after contain a polysacchride
called glycogen.

Carb - 1g = 15kJ

Human blood contains dissolved glucose being transaported
to all cell\\ Plants also use glucose in respiration
to provide them with energy and transport around sucrose
not glucose as sucrose is easy to change to strach
and back to surcrose.

Animals do not store starch but rather store polysacc's
in the form of glycogen

Test for carbs - iodine: starch = blue-black, 
 no-starch = orange-brown

Fats
---

Fats = lipids

Lipids = Carbon(c), hydrogen(h) and oxygen(o)

Lipids - Glycerol molecule and 3 fatty acid molecules

Fats is insoluble

Fats and oils used in cells to release energy

Mammals have fat underneath the skin. This cell is
called adipose tissue. This maitains heat inside the
body.

The oils provide a good store of energy for germination

Ethanol Emulsion test - if oil, breaks up into millions 
of tiny droplets otherwise clear

Questions

4.7) Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen
4.8) Used for warmth and energy
4.9) For energy to grow

Proteins molecules are made from long chains of smaller
molecules join end to end.

Smaller molecules called Amino acids

20 different amino acids

Protein - Soluble (Hemaglobin)and Insoluble(Keratin)

Functions - Making new cells, cell membrane and cytoplasm
antibodies and enzymes

Different sequences of amino's result in different molecule
shapes

Some proteins called enzymes act as catalysts, the
shape of the enzyme molecule determines the reactions
it can catalyse

Similary an antibody molecule determines the kinds of
viruses that it can attach to

Biological catalysts
---

Many chemical reactions can be sped up by SUBSTANCES
called CATALYSTS

They speed up METABOLIC REACTIONS.

Metabolic reactions are controlled by catalysts called
ENZYMES, without these reactions would move very slowly

CATALYST - A substance that increases the rate of 
chemical reaction and is not changed by the reaction

ENZYMES - Proteins that function as biological catalysts

Starch is digested to the sugar maltose by an ENZYME
CALLED AMYLASE. Protein is digested to amino acids by
PROTEASE.

CATALASE - It breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen

Hydrogen P. is very dangerous

Naming enzymes:
- Carbs - Carbohydrases
- Proteins - Proteases
- Lipids - Lipases
- Starch - Amylase
- Maltose - Maltase
- Sucrose - Sucrase

An enzyme works by allowing the molecule of substance to fit perfectly
into it

Enzyme - Lock
Molecule - Key

Intial Substance - Substrate
Final Substance - Product

Starch(Substrate) -> Amylase(Enzyme) -> Maltose(Product)

The Amylase molecule has a dent called ACTIVE SITE

The starch substance fits into the site forming an enzyme-substrate complex

The enzyme breaks apart the starch molecule

Questions:

5.1)A substance which speeds up metabolic reactions
5.2)An enzyme
5.3)Metabolic reactions
5.4)This is the enzyme used to break down substances which are carbs
5.5)Amylase
5.6)Starch -> Amylase -> Maltose

Enzymes
---

1)All enzymes are protein
2)Enzymes are made inactive by high temperature
3)Enzymes work best at a particular temperature (37c)
4)Enzymes work best at a particular pH(Alkaline, Neutral, Acidic)
5)Enzymes are catalysts(Do not change in chemical reactions)
6)Enzymes are specific(Each kind of enzyme will only catalyse one kind
of chemical reaction)

If the temperature is to enzyme the will start to lose its shape
and no longer perfectly fit. The enzyme is said to be DENATURED.
It can no longer catalyse the reaciton.

If the pH is not fitted to the enzyme it will become DENATURED.

Questions:

5.7)The temperature which it functions at its best without being DENATURED

e)The dent in the side of the enzyme where the substrate lies in to
be broken down by the enzyme

2)
a)37c
b)2pH - Acidic
c)This is because the enzyme does not break down the substrate as
fast in lower temperatures

3)

the product of the reaction into glucose and fructose

b)
i)This is the optimum temperature for the enzymes to work effectively
ii)As the pH increases from acidic to neutral it approaches its 
optimum functioning point at neutral when it starts to drop when
it approaches alkaline eventually denaturing

Plant nutrition
---

Nutrition - Taking in useful substances to release energy, build new parts
or repair old parts

Green plants make their own food by using inorganic substances

Photothynsis: Carbon Dioxide + Water + E(Sun) = Glucose

Photothynsis: The process by which plants manufacture carbhydrates
from raw materials using sunlight

Green plants trap sunlight within them using Chlorophyll(Green pig.)

6C02+6H20 SUNLIGHT+CHOLORPHYLL -> C6H1206 + 6O2

Questions:

6.1)Glucose
6.2)CO2 + H20 + Sunlight
6.3)Chlorophyll is substance which traps sunlight in the plant so
it has sufficient energy to photothensise 

Lamina - Broad, flat part of the leaf which is joined to the plant
with a PETITOLE(Running through - vascular bundles)

Top & Bottom - EPIDERMIS LAYER(No chloroplasts)
Top layer - secretes a waxy substance called the WAXY CUTICLE
Bottom layer - STOMATA surronded by a pair of GUARD CELLS
Middle layer - mesopyhll which contains chloroplasts
Middle & Top - Palisade layer, cells beneath it are spongy

Each vein - Xylem vessels for carrying water
          - Phylem tubes which carries sucrose and other substances

Questions:

6.4)Petiole
6.5)Epidermis
6.6)To keep water inside the leaf and prevent it from getting evapourated
6.7)The hole between two guard cells where the leaf absorbs C02 ????
6.8)The cells which allow for the stomata to be open or closed
6.9)Mesophyll, paliside, spongy mesophyll have cholorophyll and epidermis
has none


Mesophyll cells need CO2

CO2 gets into the leaf through stomata with diffusion

Behind each stoma is an air space which connects up with air spaces
in the spongy mesophyll

It then diffuses through cells wall and membrane into choloroplasts

Water is absorbed through xylem vessels and travels to the mesophyll
through osmosis

Mesophyll need sunlight

Large thin leaves, shady areas
Thick small leaves, sunny areas

Supported by stem and petiole - Exposes much of the leaf to sunlight + air
Large surface area - Exposes large as area as possible to sunlight + air
Thin - To allow sunlight to penetrate to all cells, CO2 to diffuse

Questions:

6.10)CO2 + H2O
6.11)0.04%
6.12)Through the stomata
6.13)Through xylem vessels which use osmosis to get it the mesophyll cells
6.14)It can absorb more sunlight and CO2
6.15)Sunlight is able to penetrate the leaf easily supplying sunlight to
all the cells of the leaf

Glucose is broken down by respiration to release energy

Glucose is converted to starch, because, less reactive, doesn't dissolve
in water and is much easier stored

Glucose is starting point for making sucrose and cellulose.

Plants need nitrogens as well of sugars to make amino acids to make 
proteins

Nitrogen is absorbed through the soil via root hairs by diffusion and
active transport

Nitrogen needs to be in more reactive form (Nitrate ions)

Chlorophyll = Nitrogen + Magnesium

Glucose -> Sucrose -> Transport -> Phloem vessels
-> Sucrose -> Glucose

Questions:

6.16) It is very reactive
6.17) Nitrogen
6.18) It is not able to create proteins and therefore grow
6.19) First Glucose is converted to Sucrose and then sent through
the Phloem Vessels to the place where the plants need it


Starch is stored into the chloroplasts therefore solutions cannot 
reach it. You must get rid of cell walls and membranes for solution
to get through


Experiment A - 6 items added - 1 = 5 items (1 is CONTROL substance)
Experiment B - 6 items added (CONTROL substance added)

Leaves - No starch (Leave in dark place for 24 hours)

Sunlight curve - Logrithmic curve (After certain point, more light != help)
CO2 curve - Logrithmic curve (After certain point, more CO2 != help)

Limiting factor - Something present in environment in short supply

Hot day - Photothensis can speed up(Active) or slow down(Closed stomata)

Glass houses = Good(Trap heat, light and CO2)+-

Questions:

6.20)Something in the envrionment which is in short supply
6.21)CO2 & Sunlight
6.22)Their stomata close to prevent water loss so they stop photothysising

Photothensis: CO2 - Oxygen Balance Important for Plants/Animals
